If you want to create new vocabulary books, consider following these principles:

If your language sounds more like e.g. German and you want to make a vocabulary
book between English and your language, then take the English-German vocabulary
book as base for your own book and translate the english words to your language.

If you want to add several languages at once, then it would be easier to
translate spanish words to your language and then see the translations of
the spanish words in other languages.

Verbs are intentionally in first and second persons plural (polite form) and 
in third person singular (masculin), so a conversation is supported. All verbs 
shall use same forms, so there is little misunderstanding about the forms to list 
when e.g. a german or english verb is tested. However sometimes other forms are 
used, too.

The past forms of verbs use first person singular, second person singular and
third person singular.

Afterwards reorder the words.
 - First words in the vocabulary book are same for all languages and shall
   help a tourist with basic situations.
 - Afterwards there are words that sound similarly between two languages.
   this shall help to quickly get as many words as possible. 
 - After similarly sounding words other words are placed in the order of
   their frequency/importance
