If you want to create new vocabulary books, consider following these principles:

If your language sounds more like e.g. German and you want to make a vocabulary
book between English and your language, then take the English-German vocabulary
book as base for your own book and translate the english words to your language.

Verbs are intentionally in first person plural and third person singular 
(masculin), so a conversation is supported and all verbs use same forms.
Sometimes other forms are used, too.

Afterwards reorder the words.
 - First words in the vocabulary book are same for all languages and shall
   help a tourist with basic situations.
 - Afterwards there are words that sound similarly between two languages.
   this shall help to quickly get as many words as possible. 
 - After similarly sounding words other words are placed in the order of
   their frequency/importance
