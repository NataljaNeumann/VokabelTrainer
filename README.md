‎VokabelTrainer is an application that gives you the possibility to train vocabulary, no matter if it is for school, study or profession. Vokabeltrainer 
is the german word for vocabulary trainer. Germany is the country I live in. The application shows you a keyboard on the desktop, where you can access the letters of other languages after installation of language packs, and
it can read the vocabulary, in case there is a corresponding language pack.
The applicaton supports three training modes:
1. Simple training will train all the vocabulary, only slightly improving the chances to hit a word, where you made mistakes.
2. Intensive training greatly improves the probability of problematic or new words to be shown from vocabulary book.
3. Most intensive training will show you only problematic or new words in the book. It ends automatically, if there are no more such words in the book.

‎In case there is a language pack the application can read the vocabulary, so you also can hear the pronunciation of the words.
When creating a new vocabulary book please name the languages in a particular way, so the application can recognize them and can read the words. Please
find below the list of languages and supported variants of their naming in the application.

moment it can become supported in the future.
